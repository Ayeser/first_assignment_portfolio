# first_assignment_portfolio
This is the first homework assignment for coding bootcamp, a portfolio website.

There are three pages on this website:

1. An 'About Me' which contains a few biographical paragraphs about me.
2. A contact page with a form for you to send me questions or comments.
3. Portfolio page containing some of my recent projects.

Enjoy!
