    <p>Hello, my name is Matthew and I'm studying to become a full stack developer with training in Javascript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design.</p>
    <p>I have a background of 12 years in pastoral ministry, having worked for churches and now working as a hospice chaplain. I have a Masters of Divinity and 4 units of Clinical Pastoral Education. All throughout my career I have found ways to use technology to engage people in the most important questions of life.</p>
    <p>This site hosts some of my recent projects. Please contact me any time with questions or comments, I would love to hear from you.</p>
    <p>Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my wife (who is also a chaplain) and my four year old daughter. To relax I read books or play video games.</p>
